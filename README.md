## Lesson plans

The goal of lesson plans is to be prepared with a loose agenda for keeping students engaged and interested. With a dynamic, curious and interested group of students, I fully expect that lesson plans will not be followed to the letter and class activities will increasingly diverge with a more engaged student body.
